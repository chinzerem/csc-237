# C++ Programming

The purpose of this repository is to store any projects, labs, or other assignments I have completed in the course, CSC 237, at Bunker Hill Community College during the spring 2021.

The course is taught in the C++ programming language. All programs were written using Visual Studio Community 2019.

You will find source files and sample (.exe) files provided in the folder with each individual tab.
